Last week I released my first WordPress plugin on the WordPress plugin repository to my surprise it has been downloaded already over 70 times this week. The plugin allows a user to upload multiple files at the same time to a form on your WordPress site. As well as adds the file to the default uploads directory and creates an attachment with the file in the Media section. You can view more info here or <a href="http://dholloran.github.com/WPMultiFileUploader">http://dholloran.github.com/WPMultiFileUploader</a>. You can also grab it from the WordPress plugin repository here <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-multi-file-uploader/">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-multi-file-uploader/</a>. Please check it out, if you have any issues let me know and I will try to help you ASAP. Please review it on the download page and leave feedback on which version it works with if you could. A few hopefully additions will be drag and drop uploading, more control through the shortcode/php function, integration into other form building plugins and possibly more form field creation.
