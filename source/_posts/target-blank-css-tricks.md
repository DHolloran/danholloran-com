I saw this [post](https://css-tricks.com/targetblank/) (Originally posted on CSS-Tricks) this week about using `target="blank"` instead of `target="_blank"` earlier this week. I was amazed that I did not learn this sooner that `blank` without the `_` allows you to re-use the same tab. I know of at least one time where I did this functionality with Javascript `window.open` and then replacing the location when it updates (I think it's been a while).

It's crazy how much there is to learn even after almost a decade. I am still finding new solutions to old problems.
