I thought this post [Just How Niche is Headless WordPress?](https://css-tricks.com/just-how-niche-is-headless-wordpress/) on CSS-Tricks does a great job at outlining how Headless WordPress can be utilized. I believe for certain situations headless WordPress is great if you like a certain tool or if you have multiple platforms you need to support.
Though for a large part of the WordPress community in my experience they are not developers, and they want things to work without much configuration. This is where WordPress shines in its simplicity while also allowing developers to harness the power available when needed.
They also mention [Strattic](https://www.strattic.com/) which is a cool tool for WordPress to generate a site statically. It gives you a lot of the benefits of Jamstack. Without as many of the downfalls or considerations, you need to make as a developer.
