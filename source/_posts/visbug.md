I was listening to the [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/) a little while ago and they had [Adam Argyle](https://twitter.com/argyleink) on talking about [VisBug](https://visbug.web.app/). It's a browser extension that is almost like Dev Tools for designers. I like the accessibility features that it has but it has a lot of other tools. Such as allowing you to update colors and move elements around the page without having to use the inspector. I think this is a good tool for designers who are not comfortable pushing HTML/CSS around but wants to be able to work with the actual site.

Checkout [visbug.web.app](https://visbug.web.app/) for more details to see how it works. You can ([download for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdockenadnadldjbbgcallicgledbeoc)) now but the Firefox extension is coming soon.
