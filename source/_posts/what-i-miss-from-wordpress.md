I started compiling this list when I first decided to switch from WordPress to Ghost for my personal blog.  Just a short list of what I do and do not miss from WordPres, might help if you are trying to make the decision on which to use.

## What I Miss
- Scheduled posts
- Large established community
- Large robust feature set
- Post preview
- Plugins
- Admin bar
- Simple TinyMCE (Would be nice to not have to remember all of Markdown)
- Familiarity (WordPress just feels like home)
- Spellcheck (Granted it is not natively supported but Chromes spellcheck seems to be disabled in Ghost)

## What I Don't Miss
- Plugins (Ya it's a love hate relationship)
- The dashboard
- TinyMCE
- Track/SVN
- Being able to easily accidentaly publish a post.
- Not being able to use `cmd+s` to save
