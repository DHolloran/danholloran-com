In response to *The End of Faith*, Sam Harris received thousands of letters from Christians excoriating him for not believing in God. *Letter to A Christian Nation* is his reply. Using rational argument, Harris offers a measured refutation of the beliefs that form the core of fundamentalist Christianity. In the course of his argument, he addresses current topics ranging from intelligent design and stem-cell research to the connections between religion and violence. In *Letter to a Christian Nation*, Sam Harris boldly challenges the influence that faith has on public life in our nation.
