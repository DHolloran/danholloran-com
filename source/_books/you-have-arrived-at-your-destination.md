Nature or nurture? Neither. Discover a bold new way to raise a child in this unsettling story of the near future by the *New York Times* bestselling author of *A Gentleman in Moscow*.  
  
When Sam’s wife first tells him about Vitek, a twenty-first-century fertility lab, he sees it as the natural next step in trying to help their future child get a “leg up” in a competitive world. But the more Sam considers the lives that his child could lead, the more he begins to question his own relationships and the choices he has made in his life.  
  
*Amor Towles’s* You Have Arrived at Your Destination *is part of* Forward*, a collection of six stories of the near and far future from out-of-this-world authors. Each piece can be read or listened to in a single thought-provoking sitting.*
