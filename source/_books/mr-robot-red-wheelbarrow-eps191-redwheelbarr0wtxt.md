Step inside the frontlines of the hit TV show *MR. ROBOT* with this new in-world fiction book by series creator and showrunner Sam Esmail and series writer Courtney Looney—the first and only book to tie in to USA’s Golden Globe® Award-winning series. The book will tell a brand-new story, reveal secrets from the show’s second season, and tease developments to come. With removable items from the world of the show, the book will give readers a chance to hold a piece of the series in their own hands.  
   
  
*MR. ROBOT* is a psychological thriller that follows Elliot (Rami Malek, *The Pacific*), a young programmer, who works as a cyber-security engineer by day and as a vigilante hacker by night. Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader (Christian Slater, *Adderall Diaries*) of an underground hacker group recruits him to destroy the firm he is paid to protect. The *New York Times* called it “relentless, sensational, and unabashedly suspenseful,” the *New Yorker* called it “terrific” and listed it among the year’s best TV, and *Rolling Stone* said it’s “easily the year’s most audacious drama” and the “best TV show of 2015.” Stars Rami Malek and Christian Slater took home a Critics’ Choice® Award and a Golden Globe Award, respectively, and the show itself received a Golden Globe Award and a Critics’ Choice Award for best television drama, along with the prestigious Peabody award.
