With extraordinary access to the West Wing, Michael Wolff reveals what happened behind-the-scenes in the first nine months of the most controversial presidency of our time in *Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House*.  
  
Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the country―and the world―has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief.  
  
This riveting and explosive account of Trump’s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including:  
\-- What President Trump’s staff really thinks of him  
\-- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama  
\-- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired  
\-- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn’t be in the same room  
\-- Who is really directing the Trump administration’s strategy in the wake of Bannon’s firing  
\-- What the secret to communicating with Trump is  
\-- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers  
  
Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people. Brilliantly reported and astoundingly fresh, *Fire and Fury* shows us how and why Donald Trump has become the king of discord and disunion.
