**THE OFFICIAL TIE-IN TO THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL GAME FRANCHISES EVER - MASS EFFECT**  
  
Titan Books will work closely with acclaimed video game developer BioWare to publish three brand new novels set in the universe of MASS EFFECT(TM): ANDROMEDA. The action will weave directly into the new game, chronicling storylines developed in close collaboration with the BioWare game team. The action takes place concurrently with the adventure of the game itself, setting up the story and events of the game adding depth and detail to the canonical MASS EFFECT saga.
