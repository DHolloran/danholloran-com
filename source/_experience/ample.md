Ample is a digital agency in Cincinnati, OH. I am working remotely as a Senior Full Stack developer.

I am currently building sites on the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), primarily using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I also help mentor other developers and help with architectural decisions.
