This was a fast-paced ~2-year bachelor program that was fully online. There I learned the fundamentals of web design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and ActionScript.

With each class being about a month-long it taught me how to get up to speed on new topics. This was a good experience since it's much like the web industry fast-paced and there is always something new to learn. One of the biggest take away was to learn how to read documentation well. This will help you use any tool, language, framework, etc. not just the tools you are using.
