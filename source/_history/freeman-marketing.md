Freeman Marketing at that time was a small agency based out of St. Charles, MO. That specialized in building custom WordPress websites for local businesses. I was an in-office contractor during my time there.

I was responsible for converting Photoshop designs into WordPress marketing websites. Along with some content and SEO strategy. For part of the time there I was helping an intern web developer as well that was in school.
