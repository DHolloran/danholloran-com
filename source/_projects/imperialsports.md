Imperial Sports is an e-commerce site built with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). That sells hats, shirts and other items. I was responsible for building out parts of the original site. Along with adding features over the past 4+ years. An [EDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_interchange) integration with the internal inventory system. A product builder that allows customers to add logos and text to products. An inventory sync system to keep the stock levels in sync with the internal inventory system. Custom integration with WooCommerce to add general features.
