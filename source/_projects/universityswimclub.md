The University Swim Club site was a site for a local swim club. I was responsible for building out the majority of the site. I built it using [Statamic](https://statamic.com/). This was my first project using Statamic and I did enjoy it. I am looking forward to Statamic v3 since they are going in the direction I wanted v2 to be. More of a package for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) instead of a wrapper around Laravel.
