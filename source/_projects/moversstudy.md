The Movers Study micro-site is an informational map showing data collected from the United Van Lines Mover Study. I was responsible for building out all the functionality of the site. I built it using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [Tailwinds.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It allows for admins to add new data each year. The map will allow users to see the change in migration patterns over time.
