Firm Exchange is a business sale platform. It's like [Trulia](https://www.trulia.com/) for businesses. I was responsible for building the majority of the application. I built it using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and Vue.js. The search uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) via [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/scout) with geo-search capability added in. I built the blog using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and a simple API to sync the header, footer and styles. This allowed the blog to stay in sync with the main application.
