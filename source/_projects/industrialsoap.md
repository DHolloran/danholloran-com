The Industrial Soap Company site is an e-commerce site built with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/). I was responsible for the majority of the store product and ordering functionality. Each customer on the site has access to different products at different prices defined in their contract. This required a large amount of WooCommerce customization to restrict access to certain products. Along with building a table of all available products. Where customers could order multiple products at a time. I built sync to keep the contract prices and products in sync. Along with an inventory, sync to keep the stock levels up to date.
