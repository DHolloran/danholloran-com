Engineered Hunting Gear (EHG) is an e-commerce site that sells outdoor clothing. Built using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/), [Tailwinds.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and some [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). I was responsible for setting up the majority of WooCommerce. Along with building the filters, product quick view and color swatch picker all in Vue.js. I built them into a must-use plugin with the plan of re-using it for other e-commerce sites.
