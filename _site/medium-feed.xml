				<title>Check Out Down Them All Extension for Firefox</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>Quick tip I figured I would share. If you ever need to download a larger amount of images and you do not have FTP access and you know the URLs. <a href="http://www.downthemall.net">Down Them All</a> extension for Firefox is great.</p>

<p>All you have to do is list out all of the URLs on a HTML page in Firefox, select them all and then right click and select Down them all then go through the settings. You can optionally rename each file, download only certain types of files and more. It works on any URL in the page wether it is a real link or not.</p>

				<title>Introducing Press CLI: A Configurable WordPress Installer</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>So I have been wanting to build a WordPress installer for a while now. It is a lot of effort setting up multiple WordPress installs in the same basic configuration to start a project. I admit it I am extremely lazy but thats okay. I also wanted an excuse to build something with the Symfony Console component which makes building a CLI tool fairly easy.</p>

<p>I like using WP CLI to do tasks to help speed it up but it has a large amount of commands to remember. Along with having to enter things like database credentials each time that never change. So I figured I would create Press CLI to add configuration and automatically run WP CLI commands along with custom commands if you like. Paired with <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/valet">Laravel Valet</a> you will not even have to setup the .dev domain it is all setup automagically from the project name.</p>

<p>You should spend your time building awesome things not running 15 commands or going through the same old 5 minute install. The three things I really want to add to finish my vision would be to automatically connect/initialize a Git repository, fully install paid plugins with serial number and almost automatically migrate a live database using WP Migrate DB Pro so you do not have to worry about it. In that time you could grab a cup of coffee or start laying out what needs to be built.</p>

<p>However, enough about why and lets get to the how you can learn more about Press CLI. Check out <a href="https://pressc.li/">https://pressc.li/</a> to get information on requirements, installation and how to use Press CLI. I plan on trying to get some screen casts of the available commands in case you are a more visual learner. Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/dholloran/press-cli">Github</a> to read the code, file an issue or request features.</p>

				<title>Setting Up Your Shell Configuration and OHMyZSH</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>A while ago I wrote  a post on <a href="/2015/09/29/setting-up-your-shell/">Setting Up Your Shell</a>. I wanted to follow up with more information about ZShell and OHMyZSH. Since both have really made using the terminal a lot easier and more enjoyable. So check out <a href="/2015/09/29/setting-up-your-shell/">Setting Up Your Shell</a> to get up to speed. This will be a very high overview of configuring ZSHell and OHMyZSH.</p>

<h2 id="zshrc">.ZSHRC</h2>
<p>First up is the .zshrc if you have used Bash before you may be familiar with the .bashrc. This is the file where all of your configuration will be stored. I use mine primarily for aliases to make some common commands easier to type. To an alias basically looks like this <code>aliasname="command"</code> so a quick alias for <a href="http://docs.behat.org/">Behat</a>, a BDD testing framework, would look like this <code>alias behat="vendor/bin/behat"</code>. You can edit your .zshrc with your code editor. I personally use Sublime Text with an <code>st</code> command setup that makes opening files from the terminal easier. You can find more information about setting up the <code>st</code> command <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html">here</a>. Once you have made any edits you need to make sure to either open a new tab or run <code>source ~/.zshrc</code> in your current tab.</p>

<h2 id="path">$PATH</h2>
<p>Since command line tools may be installed in many different places your shell needs to know where too look for possible matches. This is where your <code>$PATH</code> comes in. It allows you to tell ZShell in what directories on your system to look in when trying to execute a command. Below is a list of directories added to my path. Many tools will tell you if there needs to be a special directory added such as  <code>~/.composer/vendor/bin</code> used for <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. Where you see <code>${PATH}:</code> that is basically saying I want to append this new item to my current path. Zshell will try to look in my <code>/usr/local/bin</code> for a command and the move on to <code>~/.bin</code> and on down the list until it finds the correct tool. The <code>$USER</code> variable is used to get the current users directory name which is interchangeable with <code>~/</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/usr/local/bin:$PATH&quot;</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="k">}</span>:~/.bin

<h2 id="installing-and-configuring-ohmyzsh">Installing and Configuring OHMyZSH</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">OHMyZSH</a> is a great companion for ZShell. It allows for a large amount of configuration of your shell with plugins and themes. It comes preset with a large amount of plugins and themes. ss well as allowing you to edit and create your own so you can customize your sehll to your hearts content  You can find the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#basic-installation">install instructions here</a>. You can find the full <a href="http://ohmyz.sh/">documentation here</a> and below is a screenshot of my shell while I am writing this post.</p>

<p><img src="/dist/uploads/setting-up-your-shell-configuration-and-ohmyzsh-shell-example.png" alt="Example screenshot of my shell" /></p>

<h2 id="ohmyzsh-plugins">OHMyZSH Plugins</h2>
<p>OHMyZSH has a large amount of plugins that you can use to add functionality to your shell. You can checkout the full list of <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins">OHMyZSH plugins here</a>. Here is a list of the plugins I have installed git, osx, bower, brew, Composer, last-working-dir, npm, atom, sublime, gem, git-extras, git-flow, sudo, laravel5, and vagrant. They mainly revolve around the different tools, package managers and editors that I use. One of my favorites in the list is last-working-dir which basically just opens your terminal to your last working directory when opening a new tab or window.</p>

<p>Adding plugins is fairly easy you just need to add the name of the plugin to the OHMyZSH plugins list in your .zshrc. When OHMyZSH is installed it will add a bit of configuration to your .zshrc. You just need to find the <code>plugins=()</code> section and edit the list. The following example will add git, brew and Composer.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># Which plugins would you like to load? (plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*)</span>
<span class="c"># Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/</span>
<span class="c"># Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)</span>
<span class="c"># Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.</span>
<span class="nv">plugins</span><span class="o">=(</span>git brew Composer<span class="o">)</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="ohmyzsh-themes">OHMyZSH Themes</h2>
<p>OHMyZSH comes preinstalled with many themes you can see the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes">full list here</a>. You can even create your own themes if you like. It is pretty simple but it does take some shell scripting to complete.  I would suggest finding a them you like and possibly customizing it to your needs.</p>

				<title>Setting up Mailhog on MAMP</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p><a href="https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog">Mailhog</a> is a tool that allows all of your outgoing mail to be intercepted. This is great for your development environment since you may need to test things incrementally. You really do not want your clients or users receiving your test emails.</p>

<p>I know a lot of the cool kids are setting up Mailhog along with other develop items to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> which I use sometimes as well. However we still use <a href="https://www.mamp.info/">MAMP</a> at work building mainly WordPress sites and I could not find a write up on how to get Mailhog setup on MAMP.</p>

<p>This setup could be adapted to almost any environment since Mailhog is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and is available on multiple platforms. I may end up needing to figure out how to set it up on <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/valet">Laravel Valet</a>. I am trying it out on a small scale and may switch full time to it eventually.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>So lets get started setting up Mailhog on MAMP. You can install Mailhog through <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install mailhog</code></pre></div>

<p>To start Mailhog when OSX boots up you can use <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services">Homebrew Services</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew services start mailhog</code></pre></div>

<p>You should now be able to access Mailhog on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8025/">http://127.0.0.1:8025/</a></p>

<p>Now you will need to edit the sendmail_path configure in your PHP.ini. Which you should be able to find at <code>/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/{PHP_VERSION}/conf/php.ini</code> where {PHP_VERSION} is what every PHP version MAMP is using.</p>

<p>You will need to set the sendmail_path to <code>sendmail_path = /usr/local/Cellar/mailhog/{VERSION}/bin/MailHog sendmail test@test</code>. {VERSION} can be found by <code>$ls /usr/local/Cellar/mailhog/</code> then the folder in there will be the {VERSION} value. As of this writing 0.2.0 was the latests version.</p>

<p>Restart MAMP to make sure our changes take effect and fire off a test email. Now if you visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8025/">http://127.0.0.1:8025/</a> you should see your test email. That is all there is, pretty simple right.</p>

<p>For servers such as managed WordPress hosting like <a href="https://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a> where you can not install Mailhog take a look at <a href="https://mailtrap.io/">Mailtrap</a>. It does everything Mailhog can do and more. Once you sign up for a Mailtrap account they give you simple example code to add to your project for many different languages and frameworks.</p>

				<title>Launchcode Mentorship</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>I was mentoring this month for Launchcode. it has been a pretty good experience so far it would have been a nice option when I was learning. Many people in the industry do not have a formal education background which is ok. I do not have a CS degree if I was younger when I decided to do this I would’ve. I did do a degree that was more based on web which I feel was helpful.</p>

<p>I think things like Launchcode and boot camp type programs can be a good idea. I honestly do not think that programming in general is hard. The actual process of writing the code is general easy.</p>

<p>However, one of the hardest parts is having the drive to learn new things. I think you would get more of a real world view in a situation like Launchcode where it is semi-structured. This forces you to learn how to find solutions to problems. This is a large part of what my day is which I do not feel you would get from a traditional university. You have to figure out solutions in days/hours instead of a more week/month approach.</p>

<p>This is why I feel my degree helped me it was a bachelors degree in 2 years. It forced me to learn quickly to be able to come up. For the final project you could tell the difference in who enjoyed what they where doing. There where features that went above and beyond what you learned.</p>

<p>This will also weed out people who are not excited to develop. I can tell you from experience after days of trying to fix a problem or build a feature your not with it does chip away at your resolve.</p>

<p>Let’s face it fixing bugs and boring features are not fun. However I do it for the feeling I get when I fix something difficult or build something cool. it usually makes it all worth while. If you do not have the resolve to work through the hard parts development is not a good fit.</p>

<p>In these type of programs they are going to do anything they can to help you succeed. However, that is not enough if you do not put the work in. I feel this is a good thing since you will have to do more than just show up for work.</p>

<p>I have seen multiple developers fail because of not understanding what it takes to succeed. You have to be passionate and you have to be willing to learn.  If you don’t understand a technology that’s ok find someone to help explain it to you, watch some videos, build something over and over until it clicks. Especially when you are just getting started expect to spend a decent amount of time outside of work just figuring out things.</p>

<p>I think it’s cool that I have the chance to help someone have a chance to make a change for the better. I enjoy teaching and it’s nice to not have to do it while shipping. On the job training is tough especially for a smaller shop.</p>

<p>Even with the experience I do have I still feel the pain of the first time. Sure each language or new technology I learn makes the next one easier. It still can be overwhelming at first but you just have to ship to learn. I love Shoptalk Show’s answer to becoming a better developer “Just build websites”.</p>

<p>It’s nice when you get the structure from a program to point you in the right direction of what to build. It is also nice to have someone with more experience to help guide you. I’ve never really had any one to help guid me. The majority of what I know is from me putting the work in. I’ve broken a lot of things and spent hours on a missing semicolon. I like having the opportunity to pass some of the lessons onto someone else.</p>

<p>This is Launchcode’s inaugural Mentorship program at least in this format. I think it’s going pretty good for being the first go at it. It makes me want to look into more ways to mentor and help new developers.</p>

				<title>Looking Into Statamic Flat File CMS</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>I still have not built anything with <a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> but it seems really promising. Even at $200 a license I believe it would be worth it. Well at least if you are working on a site for a business. I would like to use it for my personal site with the static file caching mode so it would be much like the static site I have now with Jekyll. In that case $200 may be a little too much since as a developer I am fine compiling my blog and deploying it.</p>

<p>Recently at work we have been doing some work with Laravel and Vue.js. We do primarily WordPress websites which tend to break down when iterating since they are notoriously hard to programmatically test. Also as great as the plugin system is it cannot compare to using composer with smaller packages. One of the biggest upsides is the ease of use on the back end. I would say the administrator area and the community have been the two biggest factors that has kept me coming back.</p>

<p>However, building more complex UIs it starts to break down. The built in templating system has not changed in a long time. I prefer the separation of data logic from view logic that a framework usually provides. The Rest API would help somewhat with this once fully implemented. However, routes would make things better.</p>

<p>Also the database scheme by nature of how it has to be is fairly generic and has a large amount of large MySQL text fields with small amounts of data when using large amounts of custom meta. This seems to slow sites down as they scale in the amount of data. I would prefer to have a database schema that more represents the data model of the project. Also interacting with Eloquent feels more natural to me than WP_Query/WP DB.</p>

<p>So I digress I had heard about <a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> on the <a href="http://spec.fm/podcasts/does-not-compute">Does Not Compute</a> podcast but for some reason I dismissed as being a tool like Jekyll that is just a static site generator. I think static site generators are awesome but it’s hard enough to get someone to type in a text box let alone use the command line.</p>

<p>However it almost seems like the sweet site between framework, static site generators and a dynamic CMS. By default you have no database since everything is a file by default.</p>

<p>This has an interesting up side/downside. The whole site can be version controlled if you like. The tough one on that is how to you handle user generated content. Since you can both edit all the data both in the admin and in a text editor where do you draw the line. I prefer to edit as much as I can from an editor but if someone changes an option on the production site this whole utopia collapses.</p>

<p>It also to a point will be faster since you do not have a database. However at that point maybe it is not the right tool for the job or you can have a hybrid since you do have access to Laravel.</p>

<p>That brings me to my next pro part is you have access to Laravel. This is a little bit weird at first how you interact with it. However everything is there if you need it.</p>

<p>I also really like the administrator area. It almost seems like it is WordPress if they dropped backwards compatibility. They have content types which seem a lot more flexible than post types. You can actually build whole admin pages out of the 30 some odd field types and it feels much more built in than a post meta box.</p>

<p>The whole administrator is built in Vue.js components so it is easy to extend. It just overall feels less cluttered it may just be that it is no where near as mature as WordPress I don’t know.</p>

<p>You also have an indexed search built in. Instead of having to do a full MySQL text search when searching for something.</p>

<p>It also has routes built in sometimes you do not want to make a page just to have a URL. I know WordPress has the rewrite API but it’s way more complex and restrictive to do basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Oh did I mention they have a form builder built in. You can also add fields in a YAML which would come in handy with a larger form with the same types of fields. It’s so much easier adding repetitive things in a text editor. Instead of having to drag/drop and click through a bunch of text fields.</p>

<p>It’s almost as if they took a list of my personal pain points and built a CMS around it. I was reading through the docs and list of features thinking all this stuff is supposed to be difficult. Apparently it is not supposed to be this way who would’ve thought that. I am sure I will find pain points other than what to version control.</p>

<p>I would actually want to use it for everything instead of WordPress if I could. I at least want to use it when the project is more of an application that also requires CMS functionality. I know a few years ago WordPress was trying to be come an application platform which you do not hear anymore. It is really hard to build newer applications with a 12 year old code base that is totally against breaking changes.</p>

<p>I still think WordPress deserves a place in my toolbox but it may have reached its limit or maybe just lost some of its shininess. However it is better to pick the tool that is the best for the job not the one you are most comfortable with.</p>

				<title>St Louis WordCamp 2016</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>WordCamp St. Louis was held this year again at Washington University St. Louis on May 14-15 2016. Over all it was a good time I always enjoy going to WordCamps. I figured I would post my notes here <a href="http://danholloran.me/2015/03/15/st-louis-wordcamp-2015/">like I did last year</a> just cause. I have added the slides that where available as of this posting you can checkout the full listing <a href="https://2016.stlouis.wordcamp.org/2016/05/16/speaker-slides-round-up/">here</a>. Some of the later notes on Saturday kind of trailed off because I decided to fix my blog after a few issues with Github Pages and Jekyll 3. One of the downfalls to Jekyll being so easy to write with being Markdown at its core and all makes it sometimes difficult to upgrade.</p>

				<title>Laravel Forge, Digital Ocean and WebSockets</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>I recently posted an overview of how to setup Web Sockets using <a href="/2016/01/30/laravel-and-websockets/">Laravel and Socket.io</a>. I wanted to follow it up with a quick post on how to get the Web Sockets functioning correctly on a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> server using <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/">Laravel Forge</a>. I a going to assume that you have already gone through the setup process to provision a new server. Also that you have read the first post since the largest amount of work will lie there. I believe these steps should be identically for all hosting providers not Just Digital Ocean but do not quote me on that.</p>

<p>First of all we need to setup some daemons for Redis and Socket.io which forge makes extremely simple. This will allow Redis and Socket.io to run continuously without you having to worry about it, First you need to navigate to Servers &gt; Your Server and then the “Daemons” tab. You will need to add <code>redis-server --port 3001</code> in the “Command” text field and click the “Start Daemon” button this will enable Redis. You will also need to add <code>node /home/forge/mysite.com/socket.js</code>, make sure to update <code>mysite.com</code> with the domain of you site, in the “Command” text field and click the “Start Daemon” button this will enable Socket.io.</p>

<p>You can check on your daemons at any time by clicking on the eye icon in the “Status” column. You will want to make sure that both Redis and Socket.io are running. If you have any issues it is best to SSH onto your server and try running the commands manually to see make sure they are successful. HJst make sure to delete the daemon before you SSH onto your server.</p>

<p>Next we will want to move onto the “Network” tab were we can open port 3000 in the servers firewall so we can access Socket.io. You can set the “Name” to SocketIO, the “Port” to 3000 and I suggest adding the IP Address of your server but thats up to you. Then you just click the “Add Rule” button and you should be good to go. You can test the connection by navigating to http://mysite.com:3000 you should see the message “Cannot GET /”. If you see that everything should be working just fine.</p>

				<title>Laravel and WebSockets</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>Working with WebSockets and Larvel is extremely easy! If you are new to Laravel it has an event system that you can use to dispatch events for other parts of your PHP code to use. As well as Laravel supports Redis and <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> for dispatching events via WebSockets. Pusher is a fully hosted service that will handle the Node.js side of things for you. I hover will cover using Laravel events with Redis to broadcast events to <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> and using <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a> to keep all the processes needed running by default. The current version of Laravel as of this writing is 5.2 which you should already have installed and I will be assuming you are using Laravel Homstead.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies-and-configuration">Dependencies and Configuration</h2>
<p>So lets get started with installing the required dependencies.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>composer require predis/predis
<span class="nv">$ </span>npm install express ioredis socket.io --save</code></pre></div>

<p>We will then need to update our <code>.env</code> with <code>BROADCAST_DRIVER=redis</code>.</p>

<h2 id="event-class">Event Class</h2>
<p>Now we will need to create a new event.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>php artisan make:event EventName</code></pre></div>

<p>Go ahead open the new event <code>app/Events/EventName.php</code>.</p>

<p>You need to make sure that your event <code>implements ShouldBroadcast</code> by default it does not.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EventName</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">Event</span> <span class="k">implements</span> <span class="nx">ShouldBroadcast</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span></code></pre></div>

<p>For this example we will use a <code>$data</code> property to pass information to socket.io however by default you will have access to any public property.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$some_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">compact</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;some_data&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Then you will need to set the channel you are going to broadcast the events on. We will use this later with Socket.io to listen for the events.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">broadcastOn</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;event-example&#39;</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Our whole event class should now look like this.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">App\Events</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\Events\Event</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EventName</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">Event</span> <span class="k">implements</span> <span class="nx">ShouldBroadcast</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">SerializesModels</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * Create a new event instance.</span>
<span class="sd">     *</span>
<span class="sd">     * @return void</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$some_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">compact</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;some_data&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="sd">/**</span>
<span class="sd">     * Get the channels the event should be broadcast on.</span>
<span class="sd">     *</span>
<span class="sd">     * @return array</span>
<span class="sd">     */</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">broadcastOn</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;event-example&#39;</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="socketio">Socket.io</h2>
<p>Now we will need to make a <code>socket.js</code> file in the root of our Laravel installation and place the following into it.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;express&#39;</span><span class="p">)();</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">io</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;socket.io&#39;</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Redis</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;ioredis&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">redis</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Redis</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">redis</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">subscribe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;event-example&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nx">redis</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;message&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">channel</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Message Recieved: &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">JSON</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">parse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">channel</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;:&#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="nx">http</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Listening on Port 3000&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you want to update the channel you will need to change <code>event-example</code> in <code>redis.subscribe('event-example', function(err, count) {
});</code>.</p>

<p>Now we are ready to run the <code>socket.js</code> file and Redis in <strong>separate tabs on your server</strong> run the following.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>node socket.js
<span class="c"># You should see Listening on Port 3000</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>redis-server --port 3001
<span class="c"># You should see a whole bunch of output</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="event-listener">Event listener</h2>
<p>Now for simplicity you can add the following to your main view template. This basically listens for an event on the <code>event-example</code> we have setup that as fired by the <code>EventName</code> class. You will want to move this into is own separate JS file.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-js" data-lang="js"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">script</span> <span class="nx">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://cdn.socket.io/socket.io-1.4.5.js&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="err">/script&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">socketURL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;http://192.168.10.10:3000&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 192.168.10.10 can be replaced with the IP address of your server.</span>

<span class="c1">// If you are using Elixir/Browserify use commented out socket instead.</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">socketURL</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// var socket = require(&#39;socket.io-client&#39;)(socketURL);</span>

<span class="c1">// The event name is created by the event channel (example-event) we set earlier</span>
<span class="c1">// and the class name with the full namespace (App\Events\EventName).</span>
<span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;event-example:App\\Events\\EventName&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">some_data</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/script&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="event-testing">Event testing</h2>
<p>For simplicity sake when testing we can just add a route to fire the event. In reality this will happen elsewhere possibly in a controller. The main thing to take away is <code>Event::fire(new EventName('Some data about the event.'));</code> will be how you can fire the event.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">Route::group([&#39;middleware&#39; =&gt; &#39;web&#39;], function () {</span>
<span class="x">    Route::get(&#39;/fire&#39;, function () {</span>
<span class="x">        Event::fire(new EventName(&#39;Event data&#39;));</span>

<span class="x">        return &#39;Event Fired&#39;;</span>
<span class="x">    });</span>
<span class="x">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now if you open your site in one tab and go to <code>/fire</code> in the other. Then in the first tab you should see an alert with the text <code>Event data</code>. Now you have a fully functional setup with Laravel and WebSockets!</p>

<h2 id="supervisor">Supervisor</h2>
<p>So obviously we do not want to manually run <code>node socket.js</code> and <code>redis-server --port 3001</code> when we start our server. As well as make sure both commands are never closed out. So this is where <a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a> comes into play. It will handle starting both services and making sure they stay up continuously.</p>

<p><strong>The following instructions will happen on your server.</strong></p>

<p>If you do not already have Supervisor installed you can install it via <code>sudo apt-get install supervisor</code>. Then you will need to restart Supervisor via <code>sudo service supervisor restart</code></p>

<p>Now we need to set the configuration file for <code>socket.js</code>	via <code>sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/socket.conf</code>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># socket.conf content</span>
<span class="o">[</span>program:socket<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nb">command</span><span class="o">=</span>node /path/to/install/socket.js <span class="c"># IMPOTANT: Update /path/to/install</span>
<span class="nv">autostart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nv">autorestart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nv">stderr_logfile</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/log/socket.err.log
<span class="nv">stdout_logfile</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/log/socket.out.log</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we will need to setup the configuration for Redis <code>sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/redis.conf</code></p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c"># redis.conf content</span>
<span class="o">[</span>program:redis<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="nb">command</span><span class="o">=</span>redis-server --port 3001
<span class="nv">autostart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nv">autorestart</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
<span class="nv">stderr_logfile</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/log/redis.err.log
<span class="nv">stdout_logfile</span><span class="o">=</span>/var/log/redis.out.log</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we need to tell Supervisor about our new configuration.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>sudo supervisorctl reread
<span class="nv">$ </span>sudo supervisorctl update</code></pre></div>

<p>You can verify everything went ok by the following</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>tail /var/log/socket.out.log
<span class="c"># You should see Listening on Port 3000</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>tail /var/log/redis.out.log
<span class="c"># You should see a whole bunch of output</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If something does not seem to work correctly you can check the error logs via the following.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>tail /var/log/socket.err.log
<span class="nv">$ </span>tail /var/log/redis.err.log</code></pre></div>

<p>So thats all there basically is now go out and build something awesome!</p>

				<title>Why Does ExpressionEngine Save Templates in the Database?</title>
				<description>
					<![CDATA[
					<p>This is a little bit of a rant and a large amount of it may be a result of my inexperience. This is in no way saying ExpressionEngine is bad and something like WordPress is better. I feel it is more a surprise from using CodeIgniter before and CodeIgniter is used to build ExpressionEngine. Maybe things have changed in the way CodeIgniter handles MVC. Also maybe this is just a situation of a large user base needing access to more tools in your views.</p>

<p>I have been maintaining a few ExpressionEngine sites lately and one thing that seemed curious to me is saving templates in the database. I am not saying this is the wrong way to do things but just seems strange. I would want to make as few database calls as possible.</p>

<p>One reason I see is possibly the templates are not supposed to have any real logic in them. So its much like post content in WordPress which I think is fine. It rides that line between maintainer flexibility and page load speed among other things. In most templating engines I have seen they function much like this. You get access to some programming helpers without any real logic going on.</p>

<p>This still makes it kind of curious that there is an option to save as a file as well. I am not sure which takes precedence but I would hope the file does. I would think you could just read in the file not sure if there is an issue with that? I would assume it already does this so why would you also save it to the database.</p>

<p>Maybe save the diffs still when you edit so you can roll back the changes that could be helpful. However what happens when you use version control since you really should be. This will solve that exact use case in a little better way. Would you ignore your template files that just seems a little weird.</p>

<p>I would agree that this may have some benefits not sure what they are though. One thing I do not agree with is the ability to execute queries from the templates. Sure in WordPress you can execute queries from a template but thats more because WordPress templating is frustratingly procedural but thats a story for another day.</p>

<p>However I just feel that executing multiple queries mixed in with view code is weird. I personally would not feel comfortable allowing a user access to database queries. Editing HTML is one thing may make the page look a little funny but it can be fixed. You mess something up such as a query you may white screen the page or open yourself up to some sort of security issue.</p>

<p>Maybe I am missing something or am just seeing bad development practices being used. There may actually be good reasons why ExpressionEngine saves views with database queries in the database.</p>
