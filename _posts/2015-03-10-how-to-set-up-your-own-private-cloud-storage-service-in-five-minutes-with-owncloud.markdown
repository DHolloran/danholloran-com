With so many services like [iCloud](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/) and [Dropbox](http://lifehacker.com/5930706/dropbox-confirms-user-email-leaks-offers-new-security-features) getting hacked these days, it's no surprise that more people want to pull their data off the cloud. Instead of missing out on those great syncing features, though, you can create your own cloud storage service that _you_ control with a service called ownCloud.
