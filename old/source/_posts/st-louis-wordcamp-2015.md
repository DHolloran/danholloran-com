In all WordCamp 2015 was definetly interesting. I thought that the Cain and Obeland in the Morning! "show" was pretty funny.  I think my favorite talk of the day was Atomic Design Principles, I've read about it before and semi-practice it even though I could do something like that better.  I also like the podcasting panel as well it was rather informative and a nice change of pace usually I just attened the full on developer talks.

Below I have my simple notes and schedule for posteritiy and will try to updated with the Speakers slides and WordPress.tv links as they become available.

### MANAGING WORDPRESS PROJECTS (INTERMEDIATE)
*[Developer 2 | Room 201 | 11:45am | Lucas Lima]*
**MANAGING WORDPRESS PROJECTS – LET’S GET BETTER ON THIS!**

Developers and Designers love to use their creativity to build amazing things for their clients with WordPress , however it’s not always that they are able to delivery those on time. WordPress is a wonderful tool that allow us to have a powerful website up and running in a couple of hours, so why do we need to be worried on how we manage our projects? I’m pretty sure you have tons of reasons to be worried about it…

We all know how hard it is to keep the expectations of our clients in a proper level over the course of the project. How difficult it is to maintain the scope, and if it changes, how to identify the impact before the “go live” date? I would like to present some basic concepts of Project Management applied specific to WordPress projects, using the experience I got managing projects for my company.

**Intended Audience**: WordPress Freelancers and Startups

### ATOMIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES IN WORDPRESS THEMES (INTERMEDIATE)
*[Developer 1 | Room 250 | 12:30pm | Joe McGill]*
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/joemcgill/atomic-design-with-wordpress" target="_blank">Slides</a>
If you spend your days designing and developing WordPress themes, you probably find yourself building the same elements over and over. Preprocessors like Sass and Less can speed things up inside a given site, but still – every site needs menus, buttons, headers, footers, form elements … you get the idea.

Well. What if you could craft your HTML and CSS (and your preprocessor variables, mixins and so on) into isolated patterns that:

* live at a single URL, so you can share it with whoever needs access, no matter where they are in the world;
* you can use over and over again, in project after project?
* yet still rewrite and restyle as a system, such that every single implementation can look wildly different?

That’s the essence of atomic design.

If you’re like me, you’ll discover the pattern libraries you build with atomic design give you a common starting point for new projects and a consistent process for your design system. The libraries themselves are simple to maintain, simple to expand.

And once you’re up and running, you can also use the WordPress template functions to organize your theme files the same way you’ve organized your pattern library.

### UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING SECURITY TO YOUR WORDPRESS INSTALLATION (INTERMEDIATE)
*[Developer 2 | Room 201 | 2:45pm | Gregory Ray]*
Be prepared! Whether you are responsible only for running a single site for yourself, or maintaining dozens for your clients, you should know how to take reasonable precautions to secure WordPress against common attacks. We will review the types of active threats that WordPress sites face, how and why a site gets targeted, and then look at a variety of techniques for improving security.

* Some areas we will cover:
* Access controls
* Htaccess recipes to block specific attack types
* Moving key WordPress files to spoil scripting
* Obfuscation methods
* File permissions
* Coordinating with a web host system administrator
* Responding to an apparent hack
*
The overall goal will be to make your site(s) less attractive to opportunistic exploits, and give you a better sense of how to respond before (and, if necessary, after) a security breach.

#### Notes:
* Dot Gray Inc.
* .htaccess for dictionary attacks
* Disable XML-RPC
* Disable wp-config.php
* Disallow File Edit wp-config
* Disable WP version display (complete_version_removal)
* Relocate wp outside of root
* Read lock everything outside of wp-uploads. Themes?
* Disallow wp-* robots.txt
* Multi-tenancy/McCreary Method?

### AN ELEGANT WORDPRESS WORKFLOW WITH GIT (ADVANCED)
*[Developer 1 | Room 250 | 3:30pm | Bobby Bryant]*
In this talk, I would be discussing version control. But more specifically, I would be outlining a version control workflow called git flow. I would also be outlining how we use git flow in conjunction with services like beanstalk and bitbucket to auto deploy commits to staging and production environments.

I think this would be a great talk for various attendees. Beginners could begin to understand the power of version control, and advanced users could see how using git flow can be a benefit when working on larger projects, with multiple developers. As WordPress continues to make inroads into the enterprise marketplace, it is becoming more important for WordPress developers to implement safe and organized development processes.
