Quick tip I figured I would share. If you ever need to download a larger amount of images and you do not have FTP access and you know the URLs. [Down Them All](http://www.downthemall.net) extension for Firefox is great.

All you have to do is list out all of the URLs on a HTML page in Firefox, select them all and then right click and select Down them all then go through the settings. You can optionally rename each file, download only certain types of files and more. It works on any URL in the page wether it is a real link or not.
