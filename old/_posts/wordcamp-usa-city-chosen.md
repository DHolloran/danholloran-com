So the WordCamp USA city has been chosen Philadelphia [Matt Mullenweg announced it today](http://ma.tt/2015/07/wcus-philadelphia/). I was really hoping for Chicago since it is close and I really like it up there. However Philadelphia I am sure will be a great place to hold the first and second WordCamp USA! Not sure if I will attend yet since I usually go to the San Fransisco one every year might as well visit a new city. They are handling it in an interesting way setting the host city to be the same for two years. It makes perfect logistical sense but I would like the variety too. We'll I hope to see you in Philly either this year or next.
