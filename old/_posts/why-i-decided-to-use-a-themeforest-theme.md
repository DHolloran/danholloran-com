I usually get the itch to revamp my personal website every 6 months to a year.  I tend to spend a weekend hacking away at my theme and I get about 85% done before feeling stuck.  This in turn makes viewing the site a chore which in turn makes it hard to blog. So the majority of the posts I have written in the past are about the redesign of the site. Honestly I no longer feel like my website has to have a theme built by myself.

So I decided to go the [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/) route this time and short of having to tweak a few small things. Mainly the theme loaded 10+ assets that could have been concatenated other than that I found a theme I was happy with [Anima](http://themeforest.net/item/anima-multipurpose-ghost-theme/9601972).  It had the basic clean styling I wanted, it is responsive, has Disqus integration which I've used on WordPress, social share features, page change animations and more.

So this time instead of putting all of my energy into a theme that really is not that important in the larger scheme of things. I can put that energy into writing and building other things I actually want to build.  So far it has gone fairly well but it is just the beginning and compared to WordPress themes Ghost themes are extremely cheap. I am actually really happy with the decision it's really nice not having to worry about your theme.  Since I spend all day worrying about other peoples themes.
