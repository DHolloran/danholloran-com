title: Maintaining an Open Source Plugin
---

I have a few WordPress plugins in the WordPress plugin repository all in a similar state of disrepair.  Honestly building plugins are awesome and open source software is really important.  However maintaining these things sucks its amazing how much work it takes to handle the support.  I love knowing people are actively using my work its amazing.  I just wish it was easier to find help to maintain it and keep you motivated. I am sure all open source projects big and small run into this road block. 

### Ideas
- What could be imporved
- How to ask for help
- How to find someone to take over the plugin
