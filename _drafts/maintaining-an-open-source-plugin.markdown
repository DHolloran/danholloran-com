title: Maintaining an Open Source Plugin
---

I have a few WordPress plugins in the WordPress plugin repository all in a similar state of disrepair.  Honestly building plugins are awesome and open source software is really important.  However maintaining these things is tough it's amazing how much work it takes to handle the support.  I love knowing people are actively using my work its amazing.  I just wish it was easier to find help to maintain it and keep you motivated. I am sure all open source projects big and small run into this road block.

The biggest thing I have learned from my different projects is it helps to have a clear vision from the start. If you just start writting code with out any sort of plan you can code yoursefl into a corner. The project may still work fine but adding features and fixing bugs can be a pain. My main experience is in the WordPress plugin space which adds its own set of issues when using SVN. I have no real experience with SVN since I use Git as my VC. Granted SVN is not difficult but it just seems to add another road block to maintenance. There are some new projects that seem to help you get around this somewhat which I will try on my next update. I hope to get back into maintianing my plugins since some of the personal road blocks seem to be getting out of the way.

### Ideas
- What could be imporved
- How to ask for help
- How to find someone to take over the plugin
