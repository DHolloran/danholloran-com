Are "card consolidators" like [Apple Pay](http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/), [Coin](https://onlycoin.com/), etc. useful? I would say it depends, it really depends on where you shop and if you are ok still bringing a backup card. I have been using both Apple Pay and Coin for the last few months interchangebly when I can. I know the field is still yound and has a long way to go however the support really makes it tough to justify. As well as when I first ordered my coin over 2 years ago I had probably more like 5-8 cards possible in my wallet now I have 2 payment cards on average.
