So I've been trying to get in the habit of writing more but to do that it helps to have a bank of ideas. I've really liked using [Trello](https://trello.com)bro catalog my possible ideas. They have a really nice and simple app so you can jot down quick ideas. It is somewhat of a todo app but it doesn't have that linear feel of a list. You basically have a set of cards in each list and you are able to add lists of cards to each main card. That way you can see multiple lists running in parallel. This helps a lot when you have a large amount of loosely related things such as blog ideas. It almost has a mind map type of feel to it which I like. This makes it easy to add random ideas in a semi structured ways. I probably wouldn't use it for a day to day type of todo. I'm a pretty big fan of [Asana](https://asana.com) which I use all day at work and I almost used that but it almost seems like over kill for my needs in this situation.
